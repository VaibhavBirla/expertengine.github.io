									<h2>Intro</h2>
									<p>In  2016,  Cyclistic  launched   a successful  bike-share  offering.  Since  then,  the  program  has  grown  to   a fleet  of  5,824  bicycles  that are  geotracked  and  locked  into   a network  of  692  stations across  Chicago.  The  bikes  can  be  unlocked  from  one station  and returned  to  any  other  station  in  the  system  anytime. 
										Until  now,  Cyclistic’s  marketing  strategy  relied  on building  general  awareness  and  appealing  to  broad consumer  segments. One  approach  that  helped  make  these  things  possible was  the  flexibility  of  its  pricing  plans:  single-ride passes,  full-day  passes, and  annual  memberships.  Customers  who  purchase  single-ride or  full-day  passes  are  referred  to  as  casual  riders. 
										Customers who  purchase  annual  memberships  are  Cyclistic  members. 
										Cyclistic’s  finance  analysts  have  concluded  that  annual members  are  much  more  profitable  than  casual  riders. Although  the pricing  flexibility  helps  Cyclistic  attract  more  customers, We  believe  that  maximizing  the  number  of  annual members  will be  key  to  future  growth.  Rather  than  creating   a marketing campaign  that  targets  all-new  customers,   Assuming that there   is a very  good  chance  to  convert  casual  riders  into  members. 
										We  notes that  casual  riders  are  already  aware  of the  Cyclistic program  and  have  chosen  Cyclistic  for  their  mobility needs. 
										We  have  a clear  goal:  Design  marketing  strategies aimed  at  converting  casual  riders  into  annual  members. In  order  to do  that,  however,  the  marketing  analyst  team  needs to  better  understand  how  annual  members  and  casual riders  differ,  why casual  riders  would  buy   a membership,  and  how  digital media  could  affect  their  marketing  tactics.  We are interested  in  analyzing  the  Cyclistic  historical  bike trip  data  to  identify  trends.

									<h3>Key &amp; Findings</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/download.png" alt="" /></span>From the analysis we came to know that the major difference between Annual and casual members is that No annual members use docked bikes on the other hand approximately 12% of casual members use docked bikes. Another important thing to note here is that Docked bikes has the highest average ride length which is 23min (approx). Also if we compare the average ride length of both user-types on weekends and weekdays. We see that for annual members there is a little difference whereas for casual members the numbers increase by 2 mins on Weekends. </p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>Another surprising thing to note is that total ride hours of annual members is almost twice as that of a casual but, average ride length of casual is 5 minutes longer than that of a annual member. Based on these insights we have 2 things we can do in order to increase the profits of the company .<b> </p> 
									<p> 1.We can use these insights and convey them to the casual members and ask them to upgrade their plan to annual member. </b></p> 
								    <p><b> 2.Another thing we can do based on our analysis is introducing a new scheme of Weekend passes so that casual members can use the services freely without worrying about charges per minute.</b></p> 
								    <p>  This would help company expand and increase its profits. </p>
